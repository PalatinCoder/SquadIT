## Our Team
We are a team of three Computer Science students from the DHBW Karlsruhe in southern Germany. Our studies in general have a focus on the technical aspect of Computer Science. Things like electronics and hardware specific languages are part of our weekly basis. The semester splits into two different pieces, one theoretical part and one where we work in a company.

Part of the team are Jan, Rico and Ferdinand.

## Our Project
SquadIT is the project we do for our Software Engineering class. The goal is to achieve experience in working on a software project based on an agile developement. We got to chose a topic for our project and of which technologies the solution should consist.
To come up with a good topic we tried to look out for daily problems in our life which could be easily implemented.
So we came up with sports management for squads and clubs!

## SquadIT
With SquadIT we want to help sport clubs of all kinds to organize themselves. We realized that a big problem in clubs is the organization of upcoming events, like matches against other teams. With SquadIT you can add your teammates to a squad and add your events. Optimized in the communication process every member of the event can easily give feedback about new planned tournaments, meetings or other upcoming events. The solution should be simple but good and intuitive.
