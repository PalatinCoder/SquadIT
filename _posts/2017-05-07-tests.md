## We will, we will test you
Today we are going to show you our test cases.

[Here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/tree/master/Tests) you can find our test files. Both, behaviour and unit tests are located there.

Our latest build with test log can be found on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp).

The test-plan can also be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Documentation/Testplan/Testplan.pdf). It's currently work-in-progress, so stay tuned.

In the following screenshot you can see the result of phpunit - the testing framework we use - running from the command line:

Last but not least you can find our test configuration [here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Tests/UnitTests.xml).

Looking forward for your comments and stay tuned.
