excerpt: Testing makes up an important part of software development. We'll show you our test files and configuration.

## We will, we will test you
Today we are going to show you our test cases. Unit tests are the tests we run locally to check e.g. our data models, whereas we run behaviour tests on travis-ci, checking if the app behaves as we expect it to.

[Here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/tree/master/Tests) you can find our test files. Both, behaviour and unit tests are located there.

Our latest build with test log can be found on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp).

The test-plan can also be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Documentation/Testplan/Testplan.pdf). It's currently work-in-progress, so stay tuned.

In the following screenshot you can see the result of phpunit - the testing framework we use - running in Atom:

Sadly currently our tests are failing. This is due to a recent Flow framework upgrade we performed.

Last but not least you can find our test configuration [here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Tests/UnitTests.xml).

Looking forward for your comments and stay tuned.
