G'day!

This week we completed the two use cases we defined two weeks ago by writing the Gherkin files.  You can see them in [this][featurefiles] directory directly in our repository. Also, here is a screenshot form one of the files, so you can see that we have nice syntax highlighting in our editor :)

Actually, these tests are already running. We connected Travis-CI to our repository, which runs the behat tests every time we push a commit. See the test logs [here][travis].

## SquadIT is coming to life!

This time, we have a working hello world already deployed, feel free to check it out here: [squadit-service.jan-sl.de](https://squadit-service.jan-sl.de)
