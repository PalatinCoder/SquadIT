## Hey there, I'm using Zenhub!
Welcome fans, today we want to present you our new issue tracker. We're not using Jira but [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) instead.
It's directly connected to our GitHub repository. That way we won't get lost in using too much tools.

To view our issue tracker or burndown charts just install the [Zenhub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/) and visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp).

We created two sprints with a duration of two weeks each. Currently the goal of one of our sprints is to create 3 further use cases.

We'll add more issues and goals soon, so stay tuned.

Your SquadIT-team
