##Hey there!
We are a team of three Computer Science students from the DHBW Karlsruhe in Germany. SquadIT it the project we do in our Software Engineering class. With SquadIT we want to help clubs of all kinds to organize themselves.
When we got our task in the class we first thought we should do something simple but good. Thinking a few days from there on we realized that a big problem in daily life is the organization of upcoming events, like matches against other teams. With SquadIT you can add your teammates and add your events. Optimized in the communication process every member of the event can easily give feedback about new planned tournaments, meetings or other upcoming events.
