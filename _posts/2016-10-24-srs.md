## Hey there!
This week we're going to present our "Software Requirement Specification" (SRS) and our use case diagram. With both we want to determine what exactly our software will be capable of.

The SRS can be found [here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Documentation/SRS.md)!

Here you can see our use case diagram:
