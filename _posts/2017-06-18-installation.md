Hey fans,

we finally came to the point where we can offer you a full installation guide which can be found in our [Readme.md](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/README.md) of our GitHub repository. Since we know that we're all lazy, we wanted to make it as easy as possible for you and included a link to our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/0rickyy0/squadit/) in the description.

Installing our app is as simple as `docker run -dit -p 8080:80 0rickyy0/squadit`.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

Greetings,
SquadIT
