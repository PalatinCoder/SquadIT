Hello everyone.

Today we want to present you our first version of our class diagram. Sadly we weren't able to generate it automatically yet. As soon as we're able to, we will modify this blog entry with the necessary information (e.g. screenshot from IDE).

![Class Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/master/Documentation/Classdiagram.png)

As always you can find the Class Diagram in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/blob/master/Documentation/Classdiagram.png).

Cheers, SquadIT.
