## It's dangerous to go alone! Know your risks

Hey guys,

today we want to show you the process we made so far. This week we analyzed our risks in order to be aware of them and to keep track of them.

The whole Excel sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/raw/master/Documentation/RiskAnalysis.xlsx)

We also thought about our use cases and which we want to implement. We still have not-implemented use cases from the last semester, which we will implement this semester. You can find our overall usecase diagram [here](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/raw/master/Documentation/overall_UCD_s2.png).

Keep your eyes open for more.
Greetings SquadIT
