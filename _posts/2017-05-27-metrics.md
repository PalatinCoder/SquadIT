Hi there,

to keep track of the quality and maintainability of our code base we integrated [scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/) into our workflow. It integrates nicely into our existing workflow with Github and Travis, as it is also triggered by pull requests and reports status back to Github. You can see the results [here](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/?branch=master).

Some of the reported issues are false positives, like this one [here](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/issues/master/files/Classes/Controller/AbstractUserAwareActionController.php?orderField=path&order=asc&honorSelectedPaths=0): The analysis found a call to an not existing method. However, the method actually exists but is generated using reflection during runtime. Thus, we can ignore issues like this.

On the other hand, the analysis found an unused parameter in the `setSquads()` method of our user data model. Despite the analysis only reporting unused code, this has a high potential of leading to a bug, so we're obviously going to fix this.
(See this and some other minor fixes in this [pull request](https://github.com/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/pull/135))

You can have a look at the executed inspections and how we improved the code in this [overview](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/PalatinCoder/SquadIT.WebApp/inspections)

Cheers,
SquadIT
