message: "Hi SquatIT,\r\n\r\nit's nice you provided a link to the Pull Request on Github.\r\n\r\nThe ClassDiagram looks nice, but could be even better if you use different colors and maybe boxes to show what are the changes by the pattern. (We know it's hard because you used a good framework)\r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n\r\nTeam JoinSports"
