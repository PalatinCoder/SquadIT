message: "Hello SquadIT,\r\n\r\nWell done so far. Your table for the FP calculation looks good. You could improve it by inserting informations why the comlexity is low in all cases. Your FP over spent time Diagramm looks verv good too, but I think you should explain here why you have so much 'outliners'.\r\n\r\nI like your Idea, keep on!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nWaldemar"
