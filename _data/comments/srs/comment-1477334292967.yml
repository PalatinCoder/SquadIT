message: "Hey Team SquadIT!\r\n\r\nI just discovered this new blog entry about your Software Requirement Specification, in which you clearly defined how to implement your project. The SRS seems to cover all necessary requirements and constraints. It should serve you well throughout the implementation process!\r\n\r\nThe UCD is also accurate. The required components are covered and every bubble contains a verb.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPatrick"
