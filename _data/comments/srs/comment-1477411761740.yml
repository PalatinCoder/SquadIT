message: "Hello,\r\n\r\nYour project sounds interesting and helpful to organize teams. \r\nMoreover, your SRS gives a great overview about what you're planning to do. You did a really good job in the overall use case diagram too by showing the different permissions of the people. Maybe you could add a legend for the scope to your overall use case diagramm so it's easier to understand when you plan to do what.\r\nAdditionally, there are some typos in your SRS...\r\nI look forward to hear more about your project.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMarco Kolb"
